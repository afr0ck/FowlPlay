Turkey - Moving Target
 - Changes direction when player melees or gets hit

Monsters respawn on a randomized timer (This allows for grind gameplay if boss is too hard at low levels)

--- Overview ---
Base (Lvl 1) attack does 1/3 enemy health. (Melee attack damage will scale higher as level increases)
You gain experience per monster. You have 10 health per level and extra melee damage.

Extra health is lying around each level and respawns at random intervals.
Extra lives are lying around each level and respawns at longer random intervals.


If you lose a life the entire room resets. This means blob, health, lives, monsters.

If you lose ALL your lives you die and see a lose screen.

The only way to win is to defeat the Turducken. Once you enter the boss room you can't leave unless you win or die.
If you die you spawn in the room before the boss in case you want to go grind some more.
