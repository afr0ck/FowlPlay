You gain experience per monster.
In this playable we just have you kill all 6 enemies since no boss is implemented yet.
There is extra health that will restore to 100 hidden on the level.

If you lose a life the entire room resets and you have to start over from scratch with the monsters.

If you lose ALL your lives you die and see a lose screen.
